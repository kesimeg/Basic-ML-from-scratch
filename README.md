Python implementation of some basic machine learning related algorithms.
All algorithms are implemented using numpy and pandas. Also they are compared  with sci-kit's versions of the algorithms.
It should be noted that Outputs of these implementations may not match with outputs of implementations by popular libraries in every case. Library implementations are optimized for performance and extreme cases leading to numerical errors. The purpose of these notebooks is going over how these algorithms work by showing how they can be implemented.
